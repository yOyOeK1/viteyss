# yss

**yss** - stand's for **y**oyo **s**ensors **s**ervice. It was a site project for me wile developing ySensorsService for my Android aplication. Small app almost weekend project.
~ 3 yers later this document is created. Monstrosity oiyshTerminal is siting in directory. yss started as a help app for me to see upcomming data from sensors to see orientation of boat and roseta of compass. Do correction of matrix rotation.
Now it power by Vite!

## what is it

Helping project for some one who have skills in blender *.gbl but don't know how to set up a server to interact with ther sceen.
Inkscape *.svg artist with amazing drawing of a instrument. With yss you can set up **site** use svg as a base to make it interactive.
Or you know something about html/js/node/.... but you look for a quick place to set another **site** to display or have some buttons.

## what it's solving

Most important! it serves **site**.

Big collection of well known libraries and modules accessible.  Many functions to simplify set up process.

All in one place. No need to host multiple http servers.
Perfect for tinkerers.
Working similar to node-red ui but this have access to full nodejs / npm stack.
