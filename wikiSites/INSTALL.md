# Install - viteyss

Installation example scenario:

- project name    [ myViteyss ]
- directory of choice    [ /tmp ]
- os    [ linux / ubuntu 20.04 ]
- repository [ /home/yoyo/Apps/viteyss ]

### dependency

- Linux, shell access
- git
- node >= v20.19.6
- npm

### in terminal

Installation will use the repository to source viteyss. Then it will be used as a project template for your installation.

##### installing

In terminal enter commands ...

```bash
cd /tmp
mkdir myViteyss
cd myViteyss

git clone /home/yoyo/Apps/viteyss
mv ./viteyss/* ./
mv ./viteyss/.* ./
npm install
```

##### starting my project

To start it. You need to be in directory of your project then enter the command

```bash
npm run startItAsLocalhost
```

If all in good, you can enter with your web browser URL: http://localhost:8080

### !! Important !!

Copy / paste command will not work, you need to replace the names of directories and repositories to suit your needs.
So the real repository needs to be `https://github.com/yOyOeK1/viteyss.git`
