# io box

Universal box with ports. It can be use in many use examples.

This box can be use as universal colector for:

- **digital inputs**
    change of state from float reading to GND or +VCC.
    Things on / off, button, swith, yes / no

- **analog inputs**
    reading in voltage but also reading of potentiometer position to value in rage of 0 ... 4095
    electronic presure sensors, temperature resistors, ...

- **digital outputs**
    you will be in control if something is on of off
    if this will turn relay or light or .... It's up to project

- **analog outputs / pwm**


#### legend

**GND** - ground in the terms of electric polarity

**+VCC** - positive site of electric polarity

**potentiometer** - device changing Ohms resistivity in terms of electric property by rotating shaft (rotary potentiometer) or sliding it 

**relay** - electricly ingaged and disingage switch

**pwm** - Puls With Modulation
